# Wolfenstein-Defense

  This project allowed me to utilize kernal objects with the micrium operating system in order to properly share resources and schedule tasks. There game has a physics module that perfoms all the necessary calculations for the game to be more realistic. It utilizes a Capacitive sensing bar to control the movement of the player, a button to shoot at the castle with varying force, and a button to provide a shield from incoming projectiles. There are different end game scenarios implemnted such as when the player has too high of velocity and hits a wall they lose.
